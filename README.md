# Gulp Test
A repo to test Gulp

Specifically the use of pipes as used in the [healthy-gulp-angular](https://github.com/paislee/healthy-gulp-angular) project.

I've been running through 's blog - [A Healthy Gulp Setup for AngularJS Projects](http://paislee.io/a-healthy-gulp-setup-for-angularjs-projects/) and am trying to deconstruct the gulpfile.

Ideally I would like to find a way of compiling more nested components.
